    <p>Welcome to this prototype session! 
    <br><br>
    Since this is a prototype version, not every single link or task will be working. So if you happen to click on something and it's not working, don't worry - it's probably not even useful for this prototype.
    <br>
    <br>
    we also have to note that, unfortunately, our creator hasn't quite figured out the whole JavaScript thing yet, so the dragging and dropping thing is not going to happen. And those fancy wiping effects? Nope, not enabled in this session.
    <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, thanks for taking the time to check out our new app. We can't wait to hear your feedback face-to-face at the end of this session!
